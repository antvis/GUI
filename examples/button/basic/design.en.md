## When To Use

A button means an operation (or a series of operations). Clicking a button will trigger corresponding business logic.

In GUI we provide 5 types of button.

* Primary button: indicate the main action, one primary button at most in one section.

* Default button: indicate a series of actions without priority.

* Dashed button: used for adding action commonly.

* Text button: used for the most secondary action.

* Link button: used for external links.

And 2 other properties additionally.
